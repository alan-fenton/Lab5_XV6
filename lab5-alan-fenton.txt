One of the first large problems we ran into in this lab was getting the pages to
store the correct number of references, as we had run structures where the count
field had garbage data. At first, we tried to add a linked list of
multireferenced pages in the kmem structure, but we were still running into
problems with garbage data messing with the count detection.
In the end, we ended up putting an array of reference counts in the kmem 
structure, using the physical addresses of the pages to index them. We then
ran into a problem in the page fault handler, but were unfortunately unable to 
completely figure it out, or even get it to a point where the OS reliably boots.
We've left the code in and the current version uses our copyuvm_cow and page
fault handler. If you want to test our function for part 1, you should be able
to just change the copyuvm_cow call in fork (proc.c) to the standard copyuvm_cow.
